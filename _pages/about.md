<strong>Welcome!</strong>

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [IAB Nuremberg](https://iab.de/en/employee/gallegos-torres-katia/), and at [ZEW Mannheim](https://www.zew.de/en/team/kgt). I'm also a Research Affiliate at [RFBerlin](https://www.rfberlin.com/author/kgallego/) and I'm a member of the [OECD-LinkEED](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/projects/linkeed-200.html) network. I obtained my PhD Economics at the University of Innsbruck in December 2024. 

My research focuses on the integration of migrants and their socio-economic impact on host countries. I am interested in the economics of migration, labor economics, and political economy.
